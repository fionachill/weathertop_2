# Weather Top v1.0

This is an app for logging weather readings.

Baseline is an app that launches and reads some readings for a small number of weather stations. 
Each reading consists of:
* Weather Code (number in range 100-800), integer
* Temp (C) decimal
* Wind Speed (kM/hr) decimal

These readings are then presented on the dashboard.
